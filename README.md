# Nodes

- Can change their speed, within a limit
- Can change their bearing (instantaneously for the simulation's purpose)
- Have memory for their own intent and the location and bearing data from the others on the network
- Sense the time of disconnections from the network and relative locations, speeds and bearings of connected nodes

# Edges

- Distance + bearing (Euclidean)
- Signal (involves distance, map impedance and random temporal fluctuation)

# Environment

- Signal attenuates with the square of distance, plus a random temporal fluctuation
- Signal attenuates additionally with smoothly distributed spatial random fluctuation

# Consensus mechanism

-
